//! Find out what channels a package belongs to.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```bash
//! $ hab pkg channels acme/redis/2.0.7/2112010203120101
//! ```
//! This will return a list of all the channels that acme/redis/2.0.7/2112010203120101
//! is in.
//!
//! Notes:
//!    The package should already have been uploaded to Builder.
//!    If the specified package does not exist, this will fail.
